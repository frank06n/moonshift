## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to run the app on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frank06n/moonshift
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd moonshift
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 1: Run with EAS Build (Recommended)

Since the project includes native libraries we need a custom development build.

1. **Remove** the existing `eas.projectId` from the `app.json`.

2. Build the app with EAS:

   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile development
   ```

   or for a preview APK:

   ```bash
   eas build --platform android --profile preview
   ```

3. Install the generated APK/IPA on your device and start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Option 2: Manual Build with Gradle

If you want to build the APK manually without EAS:

1. **Prebuild native projects**:

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```

2. **Export JS bundle/assets**:

   ```bash
   npx expo export --output-dir android/app/src/main/assets
   ```

3. **Build with Gradle**:

   * For a release build:

     ```bash
     cd android
     ./gradlew assembleRelease
     ```

   * For a debug build:

     ```bash
     ./gradlew assembleDebug
     ```

   The generated APK will be available in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/`.

---

üëâ After installing the APK, run the development server with:

```bash
npx expo start
```
